Given a string, return a string length 2 made of its first 2 chars.

Logic-1 -- cigarParty
When squirrels get together for a party,
 they like to have cigars. 
 A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, 
 inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound 
 on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the 
 given values is successful, or false otherwise.

 Examples

cigarParty(30, false) → false
cigarParty(50, false) → true
cigarParty(70, true) → true

Logic-1 -- squirrelPlay
The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean isSummer, return true if the squirrels play and false otherwise.

Examples

squirrelPlay(70, false) → true
squirrelPlay(95, false) → false
squirrelPlay(95, true) → true

Logic-1 -- answerCell
Your cell phone rings. Return true if you should answer it. Normally you answer, except in the morning you only answer if it is your mom calling. In all cases, if you are asleep, you do not answer.

answerCell(false, false, false) → true
answerCell(false, false, true) → false
answerCell(true, false, false) → false

String-1 -- firstHalf

firstHalf('HelloThere') → HelloThere
firstHalf('abcdefg') → abcdefg
